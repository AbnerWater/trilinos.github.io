package: "Fundamental organizational unit in Trilinos."

linear_solver: "Software that finds a solution vector x for Ax = b, given a known matrix A and vector b."

sparse_linear_solver: "Software that solves systems Ax = b, where A has enough zeros that it makes sense to keep track of what is zero or day_introductory_course_on_trilinos."

nonlinear_solver: "Software that finds a solution vector u for F(u) = 0, where F() is a nonlinear function."

transient_solver: "Software that finds a solution vector x(t) at time t to satisfy dx/dt = f(x, t), x(0) = x0."
