Historically software usage has been under-acknowledged by the research community.  If you are using Trilinos, we would appreciate having a citation of our software in your publications.  For convenience, here is a suitable BibTeX entry.  Please feel free to copy and paste it into your .bib file, or use another format if you prefer.  Thank you!

```
@Manual{trilinos-website,
title = {The {T}rilinos {P}roject {W}ebsite},
author = {The {T}rilinos {P}roject {T}eam}},
year = {2020 (acccessed May 22, 2020)},
url = {https://trilinos.github.io}
}
```

If you want to cite a specific package in Trilinos, you may provide a direct link to its webpage too.  For example:
```
@Manual{muelu-website,
title = {The {M}uelu {P}roject {W}ebsite},
author = {The {M}uelu {P}roject {T}eam}},
year = {2020 (acccessed May 22, 2020)},
url = {https://trilinos.github.io/muelu.html}
}
```

Note that you may need to install the URL package:

```
\usepackage{url}
```
