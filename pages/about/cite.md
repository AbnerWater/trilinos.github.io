Historically software usage has been under-acknowledged by the research community.  If you are using Trilinos, we would appreciate having a citation of our software in your publications.  For convenience, here is a suitable BibTeX entry.  Please feel free to copy and paste it into your .bib file, or use another format if you prefer.  Thank you!
