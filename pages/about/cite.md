Historically software usage has been under-acknowledged by the research community.  If you are using Trilinos, we would appreciate having a citation of our software in your publications.  For convenience, here is a suitable BibTeX entry.  Please feel free to copy and paste it into your .bib file.  Thank you!

```

Note that you may need to install the URL package:
