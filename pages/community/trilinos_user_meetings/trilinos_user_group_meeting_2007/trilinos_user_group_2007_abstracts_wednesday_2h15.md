    Wednesday, November 7th  
    1:15 - 2:15 pm (first presentation)
      
I will describe ways in which capabilities in Trilinos ranging from basic utilities to solvers have been instrumental in enabling rapid development in the new particle-continuum arc modeling code, Aleph. 
I will give some brief background on the Aleph project and code before providing details on how Trilinos capabilities have been used to handle field solves, aggregation of particle-information to mesh entities and data manipulations associated with dynamic load balancing. 
Other miscellany such as porting and my experiences using Trilinos in other projects will be addressed as time allows.
