The guiding principles for Trilinos solvers -- scalability, independent yet interoperable packages, full vertical coverage of capabilities -- can naturally be applied to other software components that make up a PDE code.


I'll present the current state of my effort to construct a roadmap for PDE components that builds on the code base and experience of Trilinos, Sierra, Nevada, and other projects. Time will be set aside for discussion.
