We will discuss the current development of the next-generation, Trilinos iterative linear solver package: Belos. 
This presentation will provide an overview of both the developer and user side of the Belos framework. 
We will also discuss the currently available linear solvers and future solvers to be offered in this framework. 
Those users and developers who are interested in the next-generation linear solvers being developed within the Trilinos framework are encouraged to attend this presentation.
