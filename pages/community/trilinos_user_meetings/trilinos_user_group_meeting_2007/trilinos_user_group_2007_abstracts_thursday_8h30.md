    Willenbring / Shead  
    Thursday, November 8th  
    8:30 - 9:30 am  

Tim Shead will begin by discussing his recent experience using CMake as an alternative build system for Epetra. 
CMake may allow us to better support Windows users. 
We will then introduce a technique that Ross Bartlett has used to make it much easier to merge changes back from a release branch to the development branch multiple times. 
Other topics will include discussions on local management of source code, future Trilinos releases, and the Trilinos Lifecycle Model. 
Some of these topics may be revisited later in the day. 
If time permits we will end the presentation with a general discussion of future framework development efforts.
