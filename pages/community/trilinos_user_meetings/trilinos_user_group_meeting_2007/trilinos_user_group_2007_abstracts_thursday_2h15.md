    2007 Trilinos Milestone Team
    Thursday, November 8th  
    1:15 - 2:15 pm  

The FY2007 ASC Level-2 Vertical Integration Milestone effort developed the vertical integration of many new advanced Trilinos solver packages to build new predictive solution capabilities. 
These were demonstrated on several relevant problems including QASPR-related semiconductor problems modeled in Charon and a MEMS design problem modeled in Aria/SIERRA. 
In this presentation, I will cover the major goals and achievements of the milestone and I will also describe some of the areas where we had problems. 
Finally, I will discuss what some of the next possible steps could be to leverage the milestone work and maximize impact.
