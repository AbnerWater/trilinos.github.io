In this presentation I will describe the combined use of Thyra interfaces, implicitly composable operator and vector subclasses, and the linear solver factories in Stratimikos to rapidly build a wide range of specialized solution methods. 
A brief overview of Thyra and Stratimikos will be followed by a more detailed description of the implicitly composable linear operator and vector support subclasses in Thyra. 
I will present several examples including an attempt to build a physic-based preconditioner with nested linear solves, a multi-period optimization model, a fully implicit RK time integrator, and a transient forward sensitivity system.
