This presentation will primarily be a demonstration of IPython and PyTrilinos. 
IPython is an enhanced version of the python interactive interpreter, providing many features interactive users often want. 
Recent additions to IPython capabilities include the ability to control multiple processes from a single interactive shell. 
A simple configuration specialized for PyTrilinos makes it possible to interactively control a parallel Epetra communicator, making much of the parallel capabilities of PyTrilinos available to interactive sessions. 
I will first demonstrate IPython, and why users might want to use it rather the standard python interpreter. 
This will be followed by a demonstration of general parallel interactive capabilities, ending with a demonstration of using PyTrilinos interactively and in parallel.
