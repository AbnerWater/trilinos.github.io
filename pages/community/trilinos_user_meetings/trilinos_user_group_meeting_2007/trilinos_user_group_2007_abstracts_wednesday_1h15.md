    Wednesday, November 7th

We discuss our current work in extending the Titan Informatics Toolkit to handle text data. 
This work includes the development of a parallel data ingestion and term-document matrix processing server. 
In the initial development of the parallel text server, we will be integrating Epetra and Anasazi for parallel matrix classes and SVD routines, respectively. 
We will discuss some of the requirements of our project with respect to code interface, data partitioning, data analysis, matrix decompositions, load balancing, incremental data updates, parallel execution, and more.
