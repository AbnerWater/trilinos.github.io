I will briefly review the Kokkos Node API, then overview and demonstrate mechanisms in Tpetra for easing the burden of hybrid (distributed + shared-memory) parallel programming. 
Specifically, I will cover the Tpetra::HybridPlatform object and the new Tpetra Reduction/Transformation Interface, which provides an analogous capability to RTOp, but with shared-memory parallel support.
