    11:40 am - 12:00 pm

This talk presents an entry-level discussion of the Teuchos automatic memory management classes: Array, ArrayView, RCP and ArrayRCP. 
The perspective is that of a Trilinos developer, and the examples will draw from the use of these classes in Tpetra and Kokkos. 
Emphasis will be placed on automatic memory management, runtime debugging capability, and high performance usage.
