Tpetra is the next generation distributed linear algebra in Trilinos, a successor to Epetra. 
In addition to adding support for templated objects, Tpetra is built upon Kokkos, a parallel node API. 
This talk will introduce Tpetra and Kokkos, exploring some of the new features of Tpetra as compared to Epetra, and describing the capabilities provided by Kokkos.
