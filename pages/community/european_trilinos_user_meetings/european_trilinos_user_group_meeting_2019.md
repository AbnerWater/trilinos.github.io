**European Trilinos User Group Meeting 2019**  
**June 11, 2019**  
**Location:**
Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule Zürich (ETH Zürich)
Zürich, Switzerland

Co-sponsored by the [Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS)](https://www.cscs.ch)

The Trilinos Project team will be holding a one-day European Trilinos User Group meeting on June 11, 2019 at ETH Zürich, Switzerland.  The meeting will occur the day before the 2019 Platform for Advanced Scientific Computing Conference [PASC 2019](https://pasc19.pasc-conference.org) also held at ETH from June 12 – 14.

### Registration
- In preparation.

### Meeting Themes
- Overview of Trilinos capabilities for next-generation parallel computers.
- Use of Kokkos for efficient on-node parallel problem construction.
- Capabilities in KokkosKernels for parallel on-node mathematical kernels.
- US solver efforts for Exascale platforms.

Abstract
</summary>
  Intrepid2 is a performance portable C++ toolkit for the local assembly of high-order compatible finite elements. Performance portability is achieved through the Kokkos programming model. In this talk we introduce Intrepid2 and its capabilities. We then demonstrate how to discretize partial differential equations and assemble the associated finite element matrices and right-hand sides using the Trilinos linear algebra package Tpetra. Finally, we give a brief overview of other discretization tools available in Trilinos.
