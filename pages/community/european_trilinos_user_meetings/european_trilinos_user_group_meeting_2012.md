EPFL Lausanne

**Host:** [Simone Deparis](mailto:simone.deparis@epfl.ch)

**Next year:** [EuroTUG 2013](http://trilinos.org/oldsite/events/eurotug_2013/) will be held in Munich, Germany.

## Trilinos Background

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus on packages. Full details of Trilinos and links to package websites can be found at the [Trilinos home page](http://trilinos.github.io).

## Meeting Overview

The First European Trilinos User Group meeting was made possible by the large number of advanced Trilinos users in Europe. While the annual Trilinos User Group meeting at Sandia features a mixture of user and developer content, this meeting was the first pure _user_ focused Trilinos event, organized by a group consisting mostly of users.

EuroTUG 2012 also featured the first advanced Trilinos Tutorial ever offered. The advanced tutorial was requested by attendees prior to the event. Previous standard tutorial offering at numerous venues focused on introductory material.


### Meeting Organizers

Peter Arbenz, ETHZ

### Supported by CADMOS

The First European Trilinos User Group meeting was supported by [CADMOS](http://www.cadmos.org/), the center for advance modeling science of the Leman area.
