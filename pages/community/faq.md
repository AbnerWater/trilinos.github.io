<a name="GetStarted"></a>**Q: I would like to contribute to trilinos.github.io. How do I get started?**

**A:** (Note this question addresses contributing to the trilinos.github.io website. Information about contributing to the Trilinos Project can be found on the [Contribute](contribute.html) page.) If you are part of the Trilinos development team, after you register for an account (see “Register” in the footer menu), your account should be granted elevated permissions by an administrator. If you need the permission elevation process expedited, send a note to trilinos-framework@software.sandia.gov. If you are not part of the Trilinos development team, we are in the process of figuring out how to accept your contributions. If you are interested in contributing to the site, please contact trilinos-framework@software.sandia.gov.

<a name="AddPackageOther"></a>**Q: Other than adding new pages, what do I need to do when adding a new package to trilinos.github.io?**

**A:** New packages should be mentioned on:

*   [http://trilinos.github.io/packages/](packages.html)
*   If the license for the package is anything other than BSD (including if any additional third-party licenses are included in the code), the information needs to be added to the [licenses](license.html) page also. Contact [trilinos-framework@software.sandia.gov](mailto:trilinos-framework@software.sandia.gov) for assistance.
