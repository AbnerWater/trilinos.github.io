## Trilinos Spring Developer Meeting  
May 12th -- 14th, 2015  
Albuquerque, NM

## Trilinos Background

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the solution of large-scale, 
complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems. A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus on packages.

## Meeting Overview

The Trilinos Spring Developer Meeting is an opportunity for Trilinos Developers to gather once a year outside of the Trilinos User Group meeting, which is commonly held in early November.

## Meeting Format

In 2015, the Trilinos Spring Developer Meeting will take place between Tuesday May 12th and Thursday May 14th at Sandia NM in CSRI. The meeting will consist of both small group meetings and meetings with the full Trilinos developer team. The meeting will start on Tuesday afternoon with small group meetings, and will conclude on Thursday. On Wednesday and Thursday, we will hold mostly large group meetings, although some additional small group meetings may be added to the schedule.

## Program

The schedule for the Spring Developer Meeting will consist of training, as well as package, capability area, and Trilinos-level strategic planning. New this year is a converge/diverge planning format. We plan to address a few key topics by providing introductory information, then breaking into smaller groups to discuss the issue, then coming back together to share what each group discussed and try to make decisions as to how to move forward.
