If you are having trouble with Trilinos, try looking through Trilinos [documentation](http://trilinos.org/about/documentation/ "Documentation") or one of the Trilinos User Group presentations accessible from the [events](http://trilinos.org/community/events/ "Events") page. If it is possibly a package-specific problem, check out the homepage of the [package](http://trilinos.org/packages/ "Packages") giving you trouble. The trilinos-users list [archives](https://trilinos.org/pipermail/trilinos-users/) contain a wealth of information on a broad array of topics. Currently, the best way to search these archives is through a web search. If you can’t find the answer to your question, the best solution is often to send an email to the Trilinos Users mail list describing your issue in detail:

[trilinos-users@trilinos.org](mailto:trilinos-users@trilinos.org)

If you know the name of a particular developer you’d like to contact, you can find their email address at the [Team](http://trilinos.org/community/team/) page.
