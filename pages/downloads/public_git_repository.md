The main Trilinos git repository is now up on GitHub at:

[https://github.com/trilinos/trilinos](https://github.com/trilinos/trilinos)

While moving Trilinos to GitHub, a small number of packages were split off of the main repository into separate repositories. These repositories are all currently hosted in the [Trilinos organization](https://github.com/trilinos) on GitHub. All release packages are still included in the distribution tarball. For those cloning Trilinos through GitHub, we encourage users to obtain these additional packages on an as-needed only basis for simplicity, as these packages are not enabled by the majority of users.

Instructions on how to suggest contributions to Trilinos and submit pull requests will be provided in the near future.
