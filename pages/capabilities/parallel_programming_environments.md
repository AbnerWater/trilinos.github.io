From the very beginning of the Trilinos project, we have used lightweight abstract interfaces to access parallel computing machine information and services. The first interface was the Epetra_Comm layer, which had two basic concrete adapters, Epetra_SerialComm and Epetra_MpiComm. By writing Trilinos software on top of Epetra_Comm, the code was portable in both serial and distributed memory environments. Furthermore, nesting of the comm interfaces permitted additional flexibility.

Tpetra has a similar comm API, but it is present in the Teuchos package so that it is more widely available to users who donâ€™t need Tpetra.

Presently, the advent of diverse multicore, manycore and accelerator processors, makes the abstraction of parallel machine details both more challenging and more important. Trilinos has a new package, Kokkos, that provides _compile time_ polymorphism via template metaprogramming techniques. Kokkos provides multidimensional array containers, and a set of execution patterns that can operate on these array containers to perform parallel_for, parallel_reduce and parallel_scan. Current work focuses on support for asynchronous task parallelism.

The Parallel Programming Environments capability area is concerned with cross-project capability in performance portability across scalable multicore, manycore, and accelerator-based systems.
