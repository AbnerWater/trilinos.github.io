Welcome to the Thyra Home

The Thyra package contains a set of interfaces and supporting code that defines basic interoperability mechanisms between different types of numerical software. The foundation of all of these interfaces are the mathematical concepts of vectors, vector spaces, and linear operators. 
All other interfaces and support software is built on the basic operator/vector interfaces.
