This is a temporary placeholder for a forthcoming Panzer page.

For an introductory tutorial to what Panzer is, how it works, and how you use it, check out this 
[presentation](https://trilinos.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/siamCseTalk.pdf). 
You can examine the associated code by [cloning Trilinos](https://github.com/trilinos/trilinos "git clone git@github.com:trilinos/Trilinos") 
and then poking around in `Trilinos/packages/panzer/adapters-stk/tutorial/siamCse17/`.
