The successful completion of MESQUITE will provide a robust and effective mesh improvement toolkit to the broader scientific community. This will allow both mesh generation researchers and application scientists to benefit from the latest developments in mesh quality control and improvement.

**Benefits to Mesh Generation**  
MESQUITE will aid mesh generation researchers by providing a tool that improves the quality of the meshes generated by their algorithms. For example, some hexahedral mesh generation methods create topologically valid but poor quality elements; such methods will benefit from mesh quality improvement techniques that smooth the nodes enough to achieve acceptable geometric mesh quality. Furthermore, MESQUITE will provide a research platform for the development of new mesh improvement algorithms. By providing modular software with well-defined interfaces, MESQUITE will enable other researchers to easily experiment with new algorithms, new combinations of algorithms, and new quality metrics. These new algorithms can be directly compared both in terms of relative quality improvement and in terms of efficiency with the methods already in place. Currently such comparisons are tedious to perform and are therefore seldom done.

**Benefits to Applications**  
Any PDE-based simulation community will potentially benefit from the development of MESQUITE. In general terms, mesh improvement techniques will reduce the time needed to create a suitable mesh, thus reducing the time to solution, and improving the accuracy of the approximate solutions.

Research on mesh optimization performed by the present group of researchers has impacted the following simulation groups and packages:

*   Accelerator Design (Stanford Linear Accelerator). Using Mesquite to deform meshes as part of the automatic design optimization loop.
*   Oil recovery simulations (Chevron Texaco). Use of mesh optimization to align grid lines with solution flow lines to improve accuracy in oil recovery simulations.
*   Spectral element fluid dynamics computations (ANL, Paul Fischer).
*   Use of mesh optimization to smooth unstructured hexahedral meshes with an invertibility guarantee. Applied to blood-flow simulations of arterio-venous graft to understand forces thereupon. 20 minutes of mesh smoothing resulted in a savings of 4 hours solution time.
*   ALE calculations (LANL, Shashkov, Margolin). Use of mesh optimization techniques to develop the first non-adhoc mesh Rezone algorithm for ALE calculations. Method is being extended and incorporated into LANL hydrodynamics simulations to make them more robust and have less frequent restarts.
*   Alegra (SNL). A second generation mesh optimization rezone method based on our new target-matrix paradigm was tested by Alegra personnel and is being incorporated into the Alegra code for ALE calculations for Z-pinch and Magneto-hydrodynamics.

*   Cubit mesh generation package (SNL). Uses unstructured Winslow smoother as the default smoother for 2D unstructured meshes and for mesh sweeping technology; uses mean ratio smoother to smooth all-hex unstructured meshes with invertibility guarantee; uses automatic mesh untangler.
