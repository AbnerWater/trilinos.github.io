Welcome to the TrilinosCouplings Home

TrilinosCouplings provides a location for multiple Trilinos packages to be combined for testing integrated package capabilities.

### Examples

A number of [example drivers](http://trilinos.org/docs/dev/packages/trilinoscouplings/doc/html/index.html#trilinoscouplings_scaling_ex) are included in TrilinosCouplings that use the finite element method to solve the Poisson equation, an advection-diffusion equation, and a system of div-curl equations. (See the “Scaling Examples” section.)
