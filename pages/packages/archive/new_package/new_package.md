Trilinos has an open architecture that facilitates easy incorporation of new packages.
To help get new packages integrated as quickly as possible, Trilinos provides "New Package"
templates for everything that goes into becoming a Trilinos package. Trilinos also provides a number of useful services to
package developers throughout the development of a package. For more information on integrating your work into Trilinos,
contact [Mike Heroux](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~maherou/).

Browse this "New Package"" website to checkout the template website and for a glimpse into some of the other services provided
to new packages.
