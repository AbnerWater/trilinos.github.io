[xpetra](images/xpetra.jpg)

Xpetra a lightweight wrapper to both Epetra and Tpetra. The Xpetra syntax mirrors that of Tpetra.   
Xpetra enables algorithm developers to write to a single interface but be able to use either Epetra or Tpetra.   
Xpetra can also be introduced into existing code to allow for gradual migration.
