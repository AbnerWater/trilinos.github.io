Trilinos has an open architecture that facilitates easy incorporation of new packages. 
To help get new packages integrated as quickly as possible, Trilinos provides &#8216;New Package&#8217; 
templates for everything that goes into becoming a Trilinos package. Trilinos also provides a number of useful services to 
package developers throughout the development of a package. For more information on integrating your work into Trilinos, 
contact [Mike Heroux](http://www.cs.sandia.gov/~maherou/).

to new packages.
