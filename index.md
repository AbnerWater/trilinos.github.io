# Trilinos Home Page

## Welcome to the Trilinos Project Home Page

The Trilinos Project is an effort to develop algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework 
for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems. 
A unique design feature of Trilinos is its focus on packages.

## What Trilinos Can Do: Trilinos Capability Areas

[The Trilinos Capability Area homepage ]() organizes Trilinos capabilities into nine collections of functionality and describes 
which packages are relevant to each area.  This discussion is especially useful for new Trilinos users.

## EuroTUG 2016

The 2016 European Trilinos User Group Meeting will be held at the Leibniz Rechenzentrum (LRZ),â€‹ Garching, Germany on April 18th-20th.  
See [this page]() for registration information and other details.

## Trilinos is on GitHub

The [primary Trilinos repository](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos) 
is now hosted on GitHub. This allows users and potential developers greater access to Trilinos source code.

## TUG 2015

The 2015 Trilinos User Group Meeting (TUG) was held October 26th-29th in Albuquerque. 
For more information, including videos from many of the presentations, visit the [TUG 2015 Homepage]

build system, which requires CMake version 2.8.11 or greater. 
Instructions for building Trilinos 10.0 and later are available 
[here]().

## Trilinos User Group 2014

The 2014 Trilinos User Group Meeting (TUG) was held October 27th-30th in Albuquerque.

[TUG 2014 Homepage]().

## Trilinos Packages

Each Trilinos package is a self-contained, independent piece of software with its own set of requirements, 
its own development team and group of users. Because of this, Trilinos itself is designed to respect the autonomy of packages. 
Trilinos offers a variety of ways for a particular package to interact with other Trilinos packages. 
It also offers a set of tools that can assist package developers with builds across multiple platforms, 
generating documentation and regression testing across a set of target platforms. 
At the same time, what a package must do to be called a Trilinos package is minimal, and varies with each package.
