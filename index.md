The Trilinos Project is a community of developers, users and
<a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.user_developer}}">user-developers</a>
focused on collaborative creation of algorithms and enabling technologies within an object-oriented software framework for the solution of large-scale, complex multi-physics engineering and scientific problems on new and emerging high-performance computing (HPC) architectures.

Trilinos is organized around fundamental software elements called <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="{{site.data.glossary.trilinos_package}}">packages</a>.  The Trilinos package architecture enables simultaneous development of many new capabilities in a federated system.  Each package has its own name and identity within the research community, giving the package team recognition outside of Trilinos itself.

## Trilinos Product Suites
Trilinos contains many packages, organized in [five product suites](product.html):
- Data services: Vectors, matrices, graphs and similar data containers, and related operations.
- Linear and Eigenproblem solvers: For large, distributed systems of equations.
- Nonlinear solvers and analysis tools: Includes basic nonlinear approaches, continuation methods and similar.
- Discretizations: Many finite element and similar approaches.
- Framework: Tools for building, testing and integrating Trilinos capabilities.
